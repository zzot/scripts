~/Library/Scripts/
==================

This repository tracks the scripts folder on my machine, as an alternative to
having to update some post on my blog every time I make a minor edit to one
of them.

I used to push two branches, one compiled one not, but I dropped the former.
Keeping compiled scripts in a branch turned out to create more problems for
me (on my machine) than it solved, and `.scpt` files aren't readable anyway,
and that's really the whole point of pushing these.  If you want to use one
of these scripts verbatim, just download it, compile it in Script Editor
and save the result to an appropriate location.
